Our application utilizes JavaFX and JDBCsqlite. To run it correctly, it requires certain external libraries. Here's how to set it up:

1. Import External Libraries (sqlite jdbc + javafx):

a. After opening the file, right-click and select Properties.

b. Navigate to Java Build Path > Libraries.

c. You'll notice sqlite-jdbc is currently missing. Select it, then click Edit. Replace the library with sqlite-jdbc-3.42.0.0.jar which can be found in the zip file.

d. Similarly, select JavaFX in the libraries and edit its path, this step is similar to what we always do during the course.

2. Adjust Run Configuration:

a. Right-click on Main.java and click Run As > Run Configurations.

b. On the Main page, make sure to unselect all the checkboxes.

c. Switch to f(x)= Arguments page and add the following modules to the configuration: "--add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.media", please note that we're including javafx.media, which differs from our usual class configuration.

Now you're all set! Launch the application and enjoy!
